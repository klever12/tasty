          <h1>Design Decisions and Details</h1>
          <p>The page that appears when the app is opened in simple, clear, and
            easy to navigate. The logo shows what the app is for - food from
            Mom's - with a playful nod to the college's unofficial mascot. The
            green button draws attention and tells the user what to do next. The
            red text is positioned diretly below the button to make it very
            difficult to miss. This text lets the user know that some items may
            be unavailable, without making them go through the trouble of trying
            to place an order before realizing they cannot have what they
            originally opened the app to get. </p>
          <p>The menu has checkboxes right at the top to allow users to trim
            the menu down to only what their food restrictions allow. This
            reduces clutter and allows those with food restrictions to not have
            to scroll through many dishes that they cannot eat.
            The big, bold headers give clear information about what type of food
            the user is looking at and catch the eye when scrolling fast,
            allowing users to quickly scan for and find what they may be looking
            for.
            The menu itslef has its food listings in the same order as the listings are
            on the official Mom's menu, as well as the one listed on the campus
            dining website. This provides familiarity and, again, allows users
            to quickly find what they are looking for.
            The dropdown that appears when hovering over a dish allows users to
            see what they may want to try, or may dislike.
            Clicking on a menu item provides feedback in the form of a "press"
            animation. A pop-up window that appears on click and allows the user to
            enter food customization draws the
            attention of the user, telling them something must be completed
            before continuing.
            Once submitted, the green banner appears on the top of the screen is
            a form of feedback, telling the user that their dish of choice was
            successfully added to their order. The green color denotes success
            of the action, and banner at the top does not get in the
            way, since it is simply a notification and no action in required.
            A button on the top and bottom of the menu shows the number of
            dishes in their oder, and may be clicked to move to the checkout
            page. Having one at the top and one at the bottom allows the user
            to continue to the checkout without having to scroll all the way
            back to where they were before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The checkout page of the application greets the user with three
            useful sections: the order information portion, payment buttons,
            and the order buttons. The order information displays the food items,
            quantity, and price. In addition, the table gives the user the freedom
            to remove specific items they no longer need. The payment buttons
            allow the user to either pay with swipes and/or flex, which is
            displayed at the top of the screen. If they change their mind on
            their payment method, they are allowed to restart. Finally, the user
            can either return to the menu and add more items to their order, or
            they can finalize their order with the "place order" button. The
            buttons are seperated in sections, so the buttons with similar
            functionality are grouped together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The order-placed page is a simpler version of the checkout page.
            Instead of buttons that allow for payment methods, this page allows
            the user to place another order since their previous order has been
            concluded. The user can inspect what items they have in their
            finalized order, and an estimated time for the order is also displayed.
